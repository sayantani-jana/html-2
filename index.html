        <p>It’s been a long time, almost 3 years since we started our journey. A lot has changed since then. The past
          years had stories around all the emotions that are humanly possible. There was some amazing success and of
          course a lot of terrible failures.</p>

    <h1>From identity crisis to the Success Story - The DevOps revolution!</h1>
    <h3><a href="#" class="btn">Kalyan Mahalingam</a> | 05 Jul 2019</h3>
    <p>DevOps is a paradigm shift in the way how software products are being built in the modern day Information
      Technology (IT) organizations. It is becoming the de-facto component in Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)
      process in most of the organizations.</p>

    <h1>Typical day of Data Scientist - An insider story!</h1>
    <h3><a href="#" class="btn">Saurav Ghosh</a> | 05 Jul 2019</h3>
    <p>A typical day for me starts with a scrum, we prioritize action items and share our ideas with one another to have
      unbiased opinions. We then proceed to speak with key stakeholders for whichever problem we’re solving, this is
      important as keeping them in the loop often avoids long delays, fundamental errors and expectation mismatch. </p>
